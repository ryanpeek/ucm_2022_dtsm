## Study Area & System {background-image="figs/EDDI_ETrs_09mn_20221024.png" background-size="cover" background-color="gray20"}
:::{.incremental}
 - California [**is big**]{.fragment .highlight-blue}
 - Covering and monitoring a highly diverse landscape is hard
 - Add sociopolitical boundaries...
 - ...many places *don't have basic data*!

## Types of Spatial Analysis

:::{.incremental}
 - Remote sensing
 - Field data
 - Genomic Data
 - eDNA
 - Historical observations
 - Meterological data

:::
## How do we parse these data?

:::{.incremental}
 - Python >>> workflows with `snakemake`
 - R >>> workflows with `targets` 
 - Bash >>> basic script workflows
 - Excel >>> workflows?
 <br>
 - Best Practices?

## Processing and Analytics 

How does one process your type of data? What are the analytical techniques and results from your work?

## Validating Uncertainty

 - embrace the unknown
 - doing nothing is a still a decision
 
How do you calibrate and validate your models? How does one measure and communicate uncertainty?
 
## Cool Data Viz

What are the cool data visualizations from your research, both spatial and non-spatial? How did you make them?

## Other Data Bits

What are the other data that one would need to more effectively manage your study system from a suitability analysis perspective?

## Outcomes and Goals

What are the management outcomes from your work? What good does it do for society?
